This repo holds and example of the use of the cluster_framework library available from

https://github.com/JonKerridge/clusterFramework

The library enables simpler parallelization of a sequential code 
written in Java or Groovy.

The user does not have to fully understand the intricacies of parallel programming to 
be able to exploit parallelism.  The basic sequential code for an application does not have
to be changed but has to be slightly repackaged using a few simple interfaces.

The example contained in this repo uses ibput data from a file and the application code also uses
data files to undertake application processing.

Further examples will be added that do not require such data files shortly.
